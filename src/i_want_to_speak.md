# Speaking at Rust Brisbane

Who would like to speak at Rust Brisbane?

Maybe you’d like to talk about:
- deep dives into a project you did
- a new crate you’ve discovered
- safe vs unsafe rust
- embedded anything (no-std)
- tales from bug hunting
- compiler hacking / optimizing output / ASM
- profiling and performance hacks
- testing / fuzzing
- WASM / Web
- integration stories or rewriting it in rust
- upcoming features
- why rust isn't a good fit for x/why you converted something from rust to x
- why language x with better than rust
- ...anything else I haven't listed

I’d love to hear from newbies, people who just started out on rust and what they brought with them from their old language.
