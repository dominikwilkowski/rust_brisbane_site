### Painless commit-rewriting in Git
Git allows commits to be rewritten after they have been pushed, but this process has traditionally been fraught with danger.
Accordingly, it has often been recommended against, unless the person doing the rewriting (and preferably everyone else on their team) is an experienced Git user who knows how to avoid the pitfalls.
However, commit-rewriting, when done correctly, can be very useful. In this talk, I will present a tool that I have been working on (using Rust), which aims to make commit-rewriting safe and easy, even for novice Git users.
